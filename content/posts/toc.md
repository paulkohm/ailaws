The starting point for [our casebook](/posts/about-the-book) is the draft [Paul](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/paul-ohm/) created when he taught AI & Law for the first time in Fall 2023. This version did not have the benefit of Margot's and Andrew's full input, and it's full of choices that Paul will do differently the next time he teaches.

Still, we'd like to share some of this to lend a hand to the dozens of law professors and hundreds of students gearing up for a class in AI Law this semester. The PDF below contains not only a topic-by-topic summary, but the names of the cases, statutes, government documents, articles, and book chapters Paul assigned. If you have trouble deciphering or running down anything in the document, let us know.

Here is the [table of contents](/docs/ailaw.ToC.fall2023.pdf).

In addition, here is the [syllabus](/docs/ailaw.syllabus.ohmgeorgetown.fall2023.pdf).
